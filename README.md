This is a COVID-19 vaccine reservation scheduling system built in Java that enables patients to search for available caregivers, reserve vaccination appointments, and view their scheduled appointments. Caregivers can upload their availability, manage vaccine inventory by adding doses, and view their appointment schedules. The application features secure user authentication with password hashing and salt, supports both patient and caregiver user types, and uses SQL Server for persistent data storage. The system automatically matches patients with available caregivers on requested dates, manages vaccine dose inventory, and handles appointment creation through database transactions to ensure data consistency.
